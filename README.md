# Todo List App
This is a simple todo list using Spring Boot with CRUD operations.
The goal of this project is to practice Java.

### Instructions
First you need to run TodoListApplication. <br>
To check how individual function of the application work, I used **Postman**.
There you can create, read, update or delete some todo item using relevant HTTP requests
e.g to add new todo, you have to use `POST` request in `localhost:8080/todo` with body that contains `title` of todo.
ID is generated automatically.
